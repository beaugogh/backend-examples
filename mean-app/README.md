# mean-blog
A blogpost app that serves as a starting point and guideline for MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) development, with the following considerations:

- Backend
 	* Database schema with Mongoose	
 	* Pagination with Mongoose
	* Route structuring 
	* Automatic server reloading (with nodemon)
	* Request body parsing
	* Request cross-origin handling
	* Request logging
	* File uploading with multer
	* Authentication
	* Authorization
	* Node environment variables (with nodemon)

- Frontend
	* Material UI
	* Angular module usage
	* Angular routing (incl. route guard and lazy loading)
	* Angular interceptors (for error handling and authentication)
	* Angular template form and validation
	* Angular reactive form and validation
	* Material paginator
	* File uploader
	* Global configuration (Angular CLI environment variables)
	
- Missing points
	* Unit testing
	* e2e testing

	
### Prerequisites
* Angular CLI
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Yarn


The code is based on the MEAN course from [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w/featured), but with some modifications.
